NASA - NSSDCA - Spacecraft - Details (Consolidated Content)

The goals of the Deep Impact mission were to rendezvous with comet 9P/Tempel 1 and launch a projectile into the comet nucleus. Observations were made of the ejecta, much of which represented pristine material from the interior of the comet, the crater formation process, the resulting crater, and outgassing from the nucleus, particularly the newly exposed surface. The scientific objectives of the mission are to: improve the knowledge of the physical characteristics of cometary nuclei and directly assess the interior of cometary nucleus; determine properties of the surface layers such as density, strength, porosity, and composition from the crater and its formation; study the relationship between the surface layers of a cometary nucleus and the possibly pristine materials of the interior by comparison of the interior of the crater with the surface before impact; and improve our understanding of the evolution of cometary nuclei, particularly their approach to dormancy, by comparing the interior and the surface.

The spacecraft consists of a 370 kg cylindrical copper impactor attached to a 650 kg flyby bus. It includes one high- and one medium-resolution instrument, each with an imaging camera and an infrared spectrometer. The medium resolution camera has a field of view (FOV) of 0.587° and a resolution of 7 m/pixel at 700 km; the high resolution camera has a FOV of 0.118° and 1.4 m/pixel resolution. The infrared spectrometers cover 1.05–4.8 µm, with FOVs of 0.29° and 1.45°. The spacecraft measures approximately 3.2 m × 1.7 m × 2.3 m, uses a hydrazine propulsion system, X-band communication, and produces 620 W via solar arrays. It has dual RAD750 computers and uses gyros, star trackers, and reaction wheels for control.

The impactor projectile was primarily copper (49%) with 24% aluminum to minimize contamination. It had its own propulsion system (ΔV = 25 m/s) and onboard targeting via autonomous navigation and a star tracker. After separation (24 hours before encounter), it ran on battery power and transmitted images via the flyby spacecraft.

The Deep Impact mission launched on 12 January 2005, impacted comet 9P/Tempel 1 on 4 July 2005, releasing energy of about 19 GJ. The flyby spacecraft observed from 10,000 km away, captured images pre- and post-impact, and transmitted data back to Earth.

The mission revealed the internal structure and material of the comet. The primary mission ended August 2005, with a budget of $240 million.

The EPOXI extended mission combined two investigations — DIXI (Deep Impact Extended Investigation) and EPOCh (Extrasolar Planet Observation and Characterization). DIXI performed a flyby of comet 103P/Hartley 2 on 4 November 2010; EPOCh observed extrasolar planets and stars to study exoplanet atmospheres. The spacecraft made three Earth-Moon flybys for trajectory corrections and observed comets Garradd and ISON.

The mission ended in 2013 after loss of communication. Total extended mission cost: $40 million.

Comet 9P/Tempel 1: Periodic, 5.51-year orbit, semi-major axis 3.12 AU, perihelion 1.5 AU, nucleus ~14 × 4 km.
Comet 103P/Hartley 2: Periodic, 6.46-year orbit, semi-major axis 3.46 AU, perihelion 1.05 AU, nucleus ~2 × 0.5 km.
